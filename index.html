		You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.

		You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud.
